## Life and Education

Taran was born in [Hatyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_Yai), Thailand. That was in September, 2000. (He's definitely a _Y2K_ boy)

During his childhood, he was raised by his grandparents in Ratsada, a small town in the countryside of [Trang Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trang_province). His early education started in [Ratana Suksa School](https://www.facebook.com/ratanasuksaschool/?locale=th_TH), an elementary in [Thung Song District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thung_Song_district), [Nakhon Si Thammarat Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat), where he participated in many academic contests, which sparked his love of learning, especially science and history.

He then moved back to Hatyai and started his high school life in the Science and Math Ability (SMA) program of [Hatyai Wittayalai School](https://www.hatyaiwit.ac.th/frontpage). He attended a [POSN](https://www.posn.or.th/en/home-en) Physics Olympic camp at [Prince of Songkhla University](https://en.psu.ac.th/), where he truly fell in love with Physics. With enthusiasm and hard work, he finally became one of the representatives to participate in the 17th Thailand Physics Olympiad ([TPhO](https://www.facebook.com/TPhO2018/)) and received a silver medal.

In 2019, he again relocated to Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, starting his undergraduate life at Chulalongkorn University. At this place, he learned many valuable lessons from both academic and extracurricular activities. After four years of joy and inspiration, he obtained a bachelor's degree with first-class honors in Electrical Engineering. His major was communication engineering, and his final-year project was "Design and Development of Reflecting Metasurfaces for 5G and Beyond Wireless Communication Systems" under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Panuwat Janpugdee, Ph.D.](https://ee.eng.chula.ac.th/panuwat-chanpakdee/), [Assoc. Prof. Suwit Kiravittaya, Ph.D.](http://suwitkiravittaya.eng.chula.ac.th/main.html), and [Dr. Paramin Sangwongngam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Aa_1hvAAAAAJ&hl=en) from [NECTEC](https://www.nectec.or.th/).
