# Electromagnetics
{: .no_toc}

Electromagnetics is a branch of study in physics that describes the interaction of things with electricity and magnetism.
Initially, the subjects of electricity and magnetism were completely separate. However, Ørsted, Ampère, and
Faraday, discovered phenomena that linked those subjects, and Maxwell finally established a well known set of equations called Maxwell's equations in 1865. By this time, electricity and magnetism were indistinguishably interwoven, and "electromagnetism" has been used to describe the phenomena.
With Lorentz's force law, Maxwell's equations form the solid foundation of classical electromagnetics.
