# About me

_This page is under construction_

My name is Taran Anusorn. I'm freshly graduated from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.eng.chula.ac.th/), [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.chula.ac.th/th/), [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/). Many people, especially my friends at the university, usually called me **"9E"**, which came from my nickname "Nine".
